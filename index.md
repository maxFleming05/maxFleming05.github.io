# Info
Currently enrolled in college at Whitman, planning on studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. 

# Data Sources and Project Ideas

## [YouTube New](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) 
- For this data set I was interested in seeing what Youtube videos were doing better than others, furthermore looking to connect themes between them

## [Chess](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess) 
- Chess has always been a game that fascinates me with the sheer amounts of patterns that it has. I want to look into game data and see if there can be correlations tracked down to specific moves or openings.

## [Netflix Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) 
- As a semi frequent netflix user, I wanted to mostly see if there were any new shows that I should watch, on a serious note, I want to look into correlation of popularity to subject of movie or show, similar to what I would want to do with youtube

## [Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset) 
-This is more of a personal interest and curiosity of a way to make money. It would be a dive into the top selling products, looking at times of year and connecting the two. As a fun way to top it off see if I can use this knowlege to earn some money.

## [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)
-I have always been interesed in sleep data and the effect it has on health. This is due to the fact that I have always noticed that my mood is heavily effected by sleep. I would look into the age vs sleep required, effects of low amounts of sleep, and of course find the optimal amount a person should get on a given night.
