# Class Projects
  This was a project for my Data Science class where we used a kaggle dataset, then performed analysis to attempt to find a correlation between statistics that would give us an edge in our upcoming fantasy football league

  This was falling sand sim created for our group final in my Computer Simulation Methods course. It was based off of the way Noita rendered particles, and dove into object oriented programming and optimization.
