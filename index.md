Currently enrolled in college at Whitman, planning on studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. 
This website is used to store current projects that I have worked on in or outside of class.


# Class Projects
  This was a project for my Data Science class where we used a kaggle dataset, then performed analysis to attempt to find a correlation between statistics that would give us an edge in our upcoming fantasy football league

  This was falling sand sim created for our group final in my Computer Simulation Methods course. It was based off of the way Noita rendered particles, and dove into object oriented programming and optimization.

# P5JS Projects
  This was a passion project diving into a star system and trying to replicate the feeling of moving forward through space while simply interacting with a Z axis. Inspiration for this coding train video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM

# Riot API Project
  I was inspired to make this project after I combined my love for some of Riot's games and my passion for Data Analytics. League API is a great intersection where I got to learn the basics of API calls, and then got a simple working prototype for an interactive website to check recent statistics from League of Legends matches.
